 # Wrap Up

 ## Building
 I’ve also been interested in building something that could have a profound impact on someone else’s life. This year, WWDC presented a special opportunity for me to take that step. Oculi is built as a SwiftUI framework that can be wrapped around any existing app, and it’s easy to add blink and interaction listeners to any SwiftUI element. I’m planning on launching Oculi as an open source Swift Package in the near future for any developer to use.


 ## About
 My name is Evan and I’m currently a Junior at Ida B. Wells High School in Portland, Oregon. Last year I launched Nome - Music & Maps, a navigation app that builds a smart, adaptably queue for the length of a users trip to the App Store. Nome was featured on Hot New Apps, and currently sits as an “Apple Favorite” under the music section. Following Nome I also joined the search engine startup Neeva as an iOS and Android engineer where I still work and contribute today. Over the summer I also led development of the iOS app at TravSolo.
